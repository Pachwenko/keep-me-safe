Scrapes Iowa DOT 511 traffic pages for recent pictures and emails a list to myself.

## Future plans

- Integrate with weather APIs and only send email if suspected rain/snow/etc.
- Include weather alert/forecasts if conditions are met for the email
- Integrate with waze/google maps/etc. to get commute time (the longer the commute, the more dangerous it is)
